# Save Game Backup Tool

A Python application for easily backing up, managing, and restoring video game save files across your computer.

## 🎮 Overview

The Save Game Backup Tool is a command-line utility designed to help gamers create and manage backups of their save game files. Never lose your progress again by maintaining organized backups that can be easily restored when needed.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The tool now uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) that is automatically created on first run. You can easily customize:

- **Backup Location**: The directory where all game backups will be stored
- **URL Settings**: Links to external resources like SaveGame.pro

On first launch, the tool will create a default `config.ini` file in the same directory as the script. You can edit this file with any text editor to customize your settings.

Example `config.ini` file:
```ini
[PATHS]
base_backup_location = E:\save game

[URLS]
savegame_pro_url = https://savegame.pro/
```

## ✨ Features

- **Create Backups**: Back up save files from any game to a central location
- **Update Backups**: Keep your backups current with the latest save data
- **Restore Backups**: Restore saved games to their original locations when needed
- **Batch Operations**: Update or restore all backups at once
- **Safety Measures**: Automatic safety backups before any restore operations
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive activity logs to track all backup operations
- **SaveGame.pro Integration**: Look up save game locations directly through the app
- **Game Save Search**: Search for specific games on SaveGame.pro
- **Configurable Settings**: Easy configuration via an external config file
